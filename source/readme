after read in branch values, store the value as 0's and 1's in the data structure. This way will same computing time because integer comparison is faster than string comparison

tournament
- select prediction value from either gshare or bimodal 2 bit
- uses a selection table (like the one for bimodal 2 bit) strongly prefer gshare -> weakly prefer gshare -> weakly prefer bimodal -> strongly prefer bimodal
- if both predicted have the same prediction, then no update needed for the selector table
- if you're in a state of gshare and gshare's prediction was wrong, update (move toward bimodal)
- if you're in a state of bimodal and bimodal's prediction was wrong, update (move toward gshare)
